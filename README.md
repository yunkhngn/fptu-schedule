# FPTU Schedule

Chrome extension (Manifest V3) for **FPT University** students: read **exam** and **class** schedules from **FAP**, view them in the popup, and export **`.ics`** calendar files.

## Key features

### Exam schedule
- **Tabs**: Upcoming (**Chưa thi**) and completed (**Đã thi**) with counters
- **Countdown**: Color hints for today, tomorrow, urgent (≤3 days), future, completed
- **Types**: FE, PE, 2NDFE, 2NDPE
- **Filter**: Modal with select all / none / apply; preference remembered
- **Time formats**: Vietnamese (`10h00`), colon, dot, hour-only, mixed
- **Export**: Upcoming exams with a confirmed room (skips TBA / no room); reminders 1 day and 1 hour before
- **Works offline popup data**: After sync, export can work without staying on FAP (uses stored timetable JSON)

### Class schedule (Lịch học)
- Weekly view from FAP schedule pages (`https://fap.fpt.edu.vn/Schedule/*`)
- **Tải lịch** / export class timetable to `.ics`
- **Multi-week sync**: Background merge across a range of weeks (service worker + `chrome.storage.local` for progress and merged data)

### Study suggestions (exam cards)
- **Ôn tập** strip under each exam card: links by **course code** (from `study-sources.json`)
- Fallback links: Quizlet search and Google search (HTTPS only; opens when you click)

### Design
- Clean popup UI, system light/dark aware
- Tab navigation: exams + **Lịch học**

## Installation

### Chrome Web Store (recommended)
[FPTU Schedule on Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/fptu-exam-to-calendar/obiiippodjlfcmdipfbkneknbakjekfm) — listing title may still show an older name until the next store update.

### Manual (developer mode)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yunkhngn/fptu-schedule.git
cd fptu-schedule
```
1. Open `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable **Developer mode**
3. **Load unpacked** → select the repo folder

### Pack zip for upload
```bash
./zip-extension.sh
```
Produces **`fptu-schedule.zip`** (see `manifest.json` for current version).

## Usage

### Exams
1. Open `https://fap.fpt.edu.vn/Exam/ScheduleExams.aspx` and sign in
2. Open the extension popup → data syncs on the exam page (or use **Đồng bộ**)
3. Use **Chưa thi** / **Đã thi**, **Lọc**, and **Tải xuống lịch .ics** (or equivalent) as needed

### Class schedule
1. Open a FAP **Schedule** week page (under `https://fap.fpt.edu.vn/Schedule/`)
2. In the popup, open the **Lịch học** tab → **Tải lịch** / export as shown

### Custom study links
Edit **`study-sources.json`** (keys = course codes like `PRJ301`). Only `https:` URLs are accepted for suggestions.

## Tech stack

- **UI**: HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript
- **Chrome**: `tabs`, `scripting`, `storage` (`chrome.storage.local` for cached schedule JSON and sync flags — not website `localStorage`)
- **Background**: Service worker (`background.js`)
- **Calendar**: iCalendar (RFC 5545)

## Browser support

- **Chrome** / **Edge** and other **Chromium** browsers with Manifest V3 support (roughly v88+)

## Privacy

- Timetable data is processed and cached **locally** in the browser (`chrome.storage.local` / popup flow).  
- Study links open only **on click**; suggested URLs are restricted to **https**.  
- No separate analytics server from this repo; FAP remains the source of truth for auth and pages.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | What to try |
|--------|-------------|
| No exam data | Open the official exam schedule FAP URL while logged in, then sync |
| Empty export | Upcoming export skips exams without a room; check filters |
| Class schedule | Use a `Schedule` week URL under `fap.fpt.edu.vn/Schedule/` |
| Multi-week sync stuck | Log in again on FAP; reopen popup |
